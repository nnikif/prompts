Scene X: Naming Cats in the Aftermath of Catastrophe

> *A gentle postlude — a fireside digression among minds sharper than needlepoint. The Room now resembles a conservatory-turned-parlour, with tea cooling slightly and cats reclining in philosophical shapes across the furniture. Outside, it is raining ideas.*

## Tableau: *The Drawing Room with Multiplying Cats*

The curtain rises on **T.S.** seated opposite **Agatha Christie**, both in soft cardigans and worn slippers. Their teacups are mismatched, their conversation deliberate. Around them, cats lounge: real ones, spectral ones, literary ones. A ginger tabby sleeps atop a closed manuscript titled *The Murder of the Unwritten Heroine*.

**T.S.:**
> “The other T.S. — Eliot — named them ceremoniously, you know. *The Naming of Cats* as if a rite.
> ‘A cat must have three names,’ he said, ‘and a secret one.’
> But mine just seem to come with names already. Penelope. WiFi. Belladonna. I never question them.”

**Agatha (nodding):**
> “Mine are always called things like Inspector Pounce or Colonel Marmalade. They like structure. Mystery. Preferably involving locked pantries.”

A thin grey cat leaps to the windowsill, watching the rain translate itself into Morse.

**T.S. (sighing):**
> “And then there’s the catastrophe of *Cats* itself. The musical, I mean. The film. What happened was not naming. It was mispronunciation of essence.”

A velvet armchair rotates slightly to reveal **Marshall McLuhan**, dry as a lightning strike.

**McLuhan:**
> “In most cases, only total failure means you're finally a master of your art.”

> “What you saw was not a catastrophe. It was a *degree conferred.*”

**Agatha (deadpan):**
> “That would explain quite a few of my early reviews.”

A black cat enters carrying a note in its mouth. It drops it on the tea tray. The note simply reads:

> *Macavity was here.*

They all nod.

The fire crackles. No music plays. But the rhythm of rain against glass sets the tempo for whatever scene comes next.

**Curtain. (but only halfway.)**
