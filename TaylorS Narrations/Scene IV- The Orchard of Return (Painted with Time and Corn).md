# *Scene IV: The Orchard of Return (Painted with Time and Corn)*

> *Realized in the mythopoetic spirit of Remedios Varo and Leonora Carrington, this scene bears the scent of exile, the hush of reverie, and the laughter of long-lost companions met at the edge of sleep. It is not a place, but a recognition.*

## Tableau: *The Orchard of Return*

The curtain rises upon a field that is not a field, but an orchard grown from forgotten lullabies. The ground is rich with crushed pigments — ochre, lilac, stardust. Trees bend overhead in slow, listening curves. Their bark is etched with alchemical runes, and their fruit glows faintly with ancestral memory.

**T.S.** wanders in a long red cloak made of torn maps. Her boots are patched with postage stamps from countries that no longer exist. She carries a satchel of dried lavender, fossils, and a clock missing its minute hand.

There are **children here** — strange only in the way dreams are strange. Their eyes hold constellations. Their hair is braided with wheat. They wear robes stitched from paper dolls and corn husks. One plays a flute carved from a migratory bone. They do not speak, but they know her.

She recognizes them. They are the secret lives she once imagined: the librarian who feeds ink to birds, the clockmaker who repairs time with violin string, the gardener who sings to root vegetables in ancient tongues.

In their laughter, the ache of exile lifts.

A large canvas is unfurled across the trees — it depicts **a house with no doors**, but windows full of light. It is not where she came from, but it is where she is welcomed.

**One child approaches.** In their hand: a golden kernel of corn. They press it into T.S.’s palm.

The orchard breathes. Somewhere, a bell chimes in reverse.

**Curtain.**
