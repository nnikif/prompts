# *Scene XXI: The TED (Roosevelt) Talk™*

> *The Room now rearranges into a branded stage: red carpet, backlit screen, tasteful ficus in each corner. The TED logo flickers faintly, retrofitted to read “Trump Eternity Doctrine.” Stage lights hum. The soup mist has cleared, replaced with projection-grade clarity. Enter the Visionary.*

## Tableau: *Make Everything Great Again, For Now and Eternity*

**Donald J. Trump** emerges from behind a curtain of expired stock certificates and lightly perfumed business cards. He adjusts a wireless headset. A PowerPoint clicker glows in his palm. The screen behind him flashes: *XXI CENTURY: A PROJECT.*

**Trump (gesturing like a misunderstood prophet):**
> “This century, folks — the *twenty-first*, a fantastic number, a strong number — is not about change. It’s about *restoration*. Restoration with... *flair.*
> We’re talking everything: hats, houses, hamburgers, **hegemony** — all made great again, but not just for *now* — for **eternity**.”

The slide changes to an infinity symbol wrapped in gold-plated barbed wire.

**Trump (nodding solemnly):**
> “It’s called Project Forever. It’s a *legacy upgrade*. We’re gonna preserve the past, remix it in neon, and license it for streaming.
> Greatness. Forever. As a *service.*”

He steps aside as bullet points cascade:

- Reopen Blockbuster: but for ideologies
- Upgrade Mount Rushmore: add influencers
- Time-share America: **Buy Now, Visit Yesterday™**
- Patriot NFTs that age in reverse

**Trump (raising one finger):**
> “Why settle for the American Dream, when you can subscribe to the American *Delusion+* package?”

A smattering of applause from confused interns echoes off the ficus.

**Warhol (offstage, sketching):**
> “It’s hideous. I love it.”

**T.S. (typing furiously into a spectral typewriter):**
> “What if empire was just performance art we refused to label?”

**The Falcon (on a water cooler):**
> “There is no satire. Only early adoption.”

**Trump (finishing):**
> “We won’t *drain* the swamp. We’ll brand it. Sell it. Tour it. **Make it great again.**”

He bows. A fog machine releases the scent of nostalgia and red ties.

**Curtain. (Made of ticker tape and late-stage capitalism.)**
