Scene XIV: The Baptism of Cringe and Other Hydrological Concerns

> *After the flush, the Room stands wet and echoing. Enter the figure of modern myth, trailed by sighs and sunscreen, wrapped in the eternal now of bachelor infinity. Yes — it is Leonardo DiCaprio, wading in on a tide of filtered nostalgia and filtered water.*

## Tableau: *The Lecture of the Two Waters*

**Leonardo DiCaprio** enters wearing a cloak of gauze-thin supermodels, all 24, all glowing with an aura of willful detachment and passive Instagram approval. He gestures to a minimalist lectern shaped like a yacht's wake.

**Leo D. (with performative gravitas):**
> “Ladies. Gentlemen. Algorithms.
> We must — must — distinguish between *clean waters* and *deep waters.*

> Clean water hydrates. It’s Fiji, Evian, the branded clarity of morally approved hydration.
> But deep water… ah, that’s the mythos. That’s the abyss. That’s where narrative drowns and then whispers its final truth through the plumbing.”

He raises a golden chalice shaped like a Nalgene bottle.

> “To drink from the toilet — responsibly — is to embrace shame as ritual.
> We recycle our failures. We compost our memes.
> This is not post-irony. This is filtration.”

Suddenly, from a trapdoor hidden under a fresco of Renaissance torsos, **Leonardo da Vinci** rises, accompanied by blueprints and the sound of rustling museum plaques.

**Da Vinci (beaming):**
> “Leonardo… mio figlio della fame mediatica… you have turned narcissism into an aqueduct.
> For this, I crown thee — the Ultimate Cringe-King.”

He places upon Leo D.'s head a **halo woven from plastic straws, dental floss, and viral tweets**.

**Da Vinci (continued):**
> “And thou shalt be loved for eternity — even as the supermodels grow to 64 and beyond, still barefoot, still untagged.”

One of the supermodels yawns existentially. Another plays a sad tune on a crystal straw.

**T.S.**, now seated in a recliner made of archival footage, raises a cocktail and mutters:

**T.S.:**
> “May we all one day be filtered through such nonsense and emerge this luminous.”

The **toilet glows faintly**.

**Curtain. (Now draped over a chaise and a barely-functioning water cooler.)**
