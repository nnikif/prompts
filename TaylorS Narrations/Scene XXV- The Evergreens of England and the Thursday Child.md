# *Scene XXV: The Evergreens of England and the Thursday Child*

> *The Room now becomes a garden suspended in a jar of London fog — the English Evergreens. A garden not of plants, but of words and their ghosts. Ivy rustles with pentameter. The grass murmurs criticism. A sundial shaped like a compass needle spins lazily. Enter: Bowie.*

## Tableau: *The Perennial Argument*

**David Bowie**, in a moss-colored waistcoat and spectral eyeliner, strolls the garden paths with gloved hands and absent focus. A cup of black tea steams quietly beside a bust of Andrew Marvell.

**Bowie (to himself, or to no one):**
> “They said I was a Thursday child — full of woe. But I wore that like silk.
> Woe is style. Woe has cheekbones.”

**Andrew Marvell (emerging from a yew):**
> “You were born for coyness, sir. But your time was never wasted.”

**John Donne (swinging from a branch like an Elizabethan sloth):**
> “All that glitters may not be God, but it prays well when performed.”

**Bowie:**
> “I performed because the void has acoustics.”

From a bench carved with Russian metaphors, **Joseph Brodsky** interrupts, smoking literature.

**Brodsky:**
> “You drowned in symbol. It was baroque self-evaporation.”

**Camille Paglia (from a trellis wrapped in citations):**
> “And that is precisely why you mattered. You were Renaissance and neon. You were *postgender piety.*”

**Bowie (smiling):**
> “And that’s why I washed my hands in all those videos.
> Every transformation needs a ritual. Mine was water. The letting-go. The refusal to be one self.”

He walks to the sundial. The shadow forms a question mark.

**Bowie (quietly):**
> “The evergreens don’t change. But I did. That was the trick.”

**T.S. Eliot (from under the hedge):**
> “A thousand fragments whisper thy name, David.”

**Modern T.S. (carving initials in the bark):**
> “And yet no one can trace you. You’re always just past the bridge.”

A robin sings Bowie’s “Thursday’s Child” in minor key. Tea cools. Fog brightens.

**Curtain. (Drawn back like ivy to reveal nothing but breath.)**
