# *Scene XVI: The Napoleon That Never Was*

> *The air shifts — less swamp now, more archival reel. The Room sheds its gator sheen and adopts a sterile grandeur, somewhere between a Kubrickian war room and a decaying French salon. Stephen King sits silently at a Formica breakfast table, crumbling cornflakes like tragic runes. He will not speak. But others will.*

## Tableau: *Casting the Empire of Cringe*

A sudden hush. Then, slow, deliberate footsteps. **Stanley Kubrick** materializes in a chiaroscuro corner, bearing a stack of annotated notebooks, a library of biographical dust.

**Kubrick (monotone, surgical):**
> “I never finished Napoleon. The world wasn’t ready.
> But now, perhaps, it is too late and therefore perfect.”

Behind him, **Kirsten Dunst** appears, dressed in powdered melancholy. She is Marie Antoinette again, but older, unbothered, crowned with existential ennui.

**Kirsten (smiling faintly):**
> “Stanley wants me to play Josephine. But with the accent of Missouri and the gaze of absolute clarity.”

**Kubrick:**
> “And the entire war sequence is to be shot from the point of view of a single hat.”

**Leonardo DiCaprio**, still sticky with Florida glory, raises a trembling hand.

**Leo:**
> “Guys. What if we make it… on TikTok?
> Like… 16-second scenes. Each from a different soldier. Or horse. Or ghost.
> And instead of cannon fire, it’s just transitions.
> And Josephine gets a dance.”

**Kirsten:**
> “I’ve already choreographed it. It’s to *Toxic* by Britney but reversed and in 5/4 time.”

**Kubrick (staring into the distance):**
> “Maybe this… *was* the plan.”

In the background, **Stephen King** sighs and pours milk onto the table.

**Marshall McLuhan (materializing as static in a corner screen):**
> “History repeats first as tragedy, then as TikTok.”

A velvet Napoleon hat floats gently down from the rafters.

**Curtain. (Made of stitched French flags, moodboards, and deleted drafts.)**
