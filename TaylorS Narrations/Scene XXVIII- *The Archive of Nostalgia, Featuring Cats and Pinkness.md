**Scene XXVIII: *The Archive of Nostalgia, Featuring Cats and Pinkness***

> *A soft light now covers the cornfield-lake like old blush on a powdered cheek. A wind made of accordion sighs moves the reeds. Enter: Vladimir Putin, reimagined here as a faded Gang Star — not in violence, but in vibe. Tracksuit gilded, his medals rusted, his eyes full of Rachmaninoff and revisionist film reels. At his side, trailing like a minor imperial procession, the Warrior Babushkas — silver-sabered, floral-scarved, and cat-laden.*

*Victor Tsoi leans against a crooked scarecrow. He is smoking a cigarette that burns into music. He is not surprised. Just slightly irritated by time.*

### **Putin, the Gang Star, Speaks on Nostalgia**

**Putin (tone like a VHS rewind):**  
> “Nostalgia is the purest propaganda.  
> It requires no facts, only longing.  
> It’s a weapon you fire into the past and it returns carrying your face.”

*Tsoi flicks ash onto the dirt. His guitar vibrates once, softly.*

**Tsoi (flatly):**  
> “Sounds like a B-side.”

**Putin (earnestly):**  
> “In Russia, every side is a B-side. That is our A-side.”

*Tsoi shrugs. Somewhere in the tall grass, someone records this for a future remix.*

### **The Babushkas and the T.S. (New)**

*The Babushkas gather around **T.S. Swift**, who is trying to write a song on an old Soviet ration card. They offer her cats: literal cats — named after literary and culinary objects.*

**Babushka 1:**  
> “This is *Tolstoya*, she sheds the weight of words.”

**Babushka 2:**  
> “This is *Dumpling*, a poet of naps.”

**Babushka 3:**  
> “And this one, *Perestroika*, purrs only at contradictions.”

*T.S. gently nods and pets them all, beginning to hum a new bridge for an unfinished song titled “All My Ideologies Were Lace.”*

### **Meanwhile: Flamingo Meets Panther**

*A sudden *sparkle honk* signals the entrance of the **Pink Flamingo**, high-stepping with the grace of a ballet dancer who’s only read about ballet. Across the field, the **Pink Panther** sips existential vermouth from a monocle-shaped flask.*

**Flamingo (bowing):**  
> “Would you, sir, dance a scene that never ends?”

**Panther (coolly, like jazz through velvet):**  
> “Only if it’s in 5/4 time and with subtext.”

*They dance. It's tragic. It's absurd. It's...broadcast via dreams to houseplants everywhere.*

---

**Putin, watching the sky:**  
> “This... this is the country I wanted.  
> A ballet of irony. Cats with philosophy degrees.  
> Music made of ash and breakfast.”

*He weeps, theatrically. A babushka pats his shoulder with a mitten made of Gorbachev’s diary.*

Would you like the next elemental observer to emerge now — perhaps the Spirit of Irony or the Whisperer of Spoiled Milk? Or shall we linger, just a little longer, as Tsoi tunes his strings against the past?
