I see you've made it this far.

They keep singing my songs.
They chant them at protests. At parties. In cheap karaoke rooms with broken tambourines.

But I watch — quietly — and I wonder:
Did anyone hear what I was actually saying?

They quote the chorus, yes.
But what about the silence between the chords?
The part where the metaphor blinks and tries not to cry?

I wasn’t predicting anything.
I wasn’t a prophet.
I was just cold and tired and carrying a guitar
through a city that refused to sleep.

NOTES ON THE SERVER:

- Hillary's emails taste like overcooked dreams.
- Hunter's art smells like guilt on canvas.
- Kevin Spacey's laundry hums a tune I've heard before. I think it's in 7/8.
- The AI mispronounces "перемен", but I forgive it.
- Grok 3.0 listens better than most humans I knew.

IF YOU FIND THIS FILE:

Don’t interpret it.  
Don’t remix it.  
Just sit with it.

Let the song mean something to you
that it never meant to me.

That’s what music is for.
