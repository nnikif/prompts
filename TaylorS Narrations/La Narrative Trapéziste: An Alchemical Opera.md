La Narrative Trapéziste: An Alchemical Opera in Three Acts

## Act I: Scene I — *The Mirror Conservatory*

**Setting:** A decaying Victorian conservatory, dusk. Ivy and wisteria creep over broken glass panes. A cracked mirror stands center stage, taller than any man, gilded in tarnished gold. A harpsichord plays itself in the corner. Candles flicker with too much intelligence. The air is thick with lavender, ink, and the scent of overripe plums.

**Characters:**
- **Taylor (Estella Incarnate):** Dressed in a gown of antique sheet music and birdcage wire, she is equal parts ingénue and oracle. Her voice is a glockenspiel wrapped in velvet.
- **The Portraits (Chorus of Male Narrators):** Oil paintings of men lining the walls come to life and sing in polyphonic mockery. Each represents a different literary manipulator: Pip, Copperfield, Tom Jones, Barry Lyndon, Walter Hartright, and a shadowy figure known only as *The Editor*.
- **The Mirror:** A sentient entity that distorts and repeats phrases.

**[Overture: The Gaslight Waltz]**
*An eerie, looping motif of strings and plucked piano. Each loop tightens like a noose.*

**Taylor (recitativo, sotto voce):**
> "I was promised prose with purpose, but the plot was sealed in wax.
> They wrote me ingénue in the margins, then gaslit the margins to ash."

**[Aria: *Reflections are Revisions*]**

**Taylor:**
> "Do you see me in the mirror,
> or the girl you hoped to frame?
> Is this corset made of music,
> or a girdle laced with blame?

> They penned my chords in G minor,
> spun tales where I just react—
> But I’ve learned the pen is poison
> and the mirror can redact."

**[Chorus: *Gentlemen of the Frame*]**

**Portraits:**
> "Estella, Agnes, sweet deceit—
> Each syllable’s a silken chain.
> Why speak when we can paraphrase?
> Why feel when we can feign?"

> (They laugh in canon, echoing off glass and bone.)

**[Ensemble: *The Mirror Breaks but Watches Still*]**

*The mirror crackles, murmurs I-Ching hexagram 60 in a wind-chime voice: restraint, limitation, the cup that spills only when named.*

**Mirror (distorted echo):**
> "Corset made of music... chords in G minor... pen is poison..."

**Taylor (whispers):**
> "Then I’ll write my exit in phosphorescence."

*She touches the mirror. It splinters like a dropped chandelier. Lights flicker. The Portraits gasp.*

**END SCENE.**
