Scene XIII: The Inevitable Reclamation

> *The lights flicker. The throne still smokes from the glitterblast of Scene XII. All the self-anointed cringe laureates have scattered, their soliloquies evaporating into self-aware meme fog. The Room resets itself — badly. The wallpaper peels in patterns that whisper “too much.”*

## Tableau: *The Youth Interruptus*

The doors (none of which existed before) burst open. In walks a procession no prophecy predicted, no canon accounted for.

**Billie Eilish**, barefoot, cloaked in someone’s grandmother’s curtains, high on whatever the word *vibe* used to mean. She is sipping something out of a sippy cup shaped like a Grecian urn.

**Nessa Barrett**, eyeliner like war paint, scrolling mid-stride, muttering snippets of witch-pop lyrics no one else has heard yet.

**Greta Thunberg**, radiant and angry, wearing a sash that reads “EXTINCTION HAS TASTED BETTER DAYS,” pushing a shopping cart filled with melting trophies, obsolete iPhones, and a copy of *Walden* bound in seaweed.

**Meme Cat**, hovering slightly above ground, its eyes twin voids of judgment and detachment. It meows once. Reality stutters.

And finally, **Barron Trump**, ten feet tall in energy if not stature, dressed like he lost a fencing match with Prince Zuko and Napoleon Dynamite, carrying a lacrosse stick made of ancestral dysfunction.

They converge on the **throne**, or what’s left of it.

Without speaking, they:
1. Pick up the **Grand Master Cringe** medallion (now sticky).
2. **Lick it** — each, solemnly, like a bizarre communion.
3. Pour it into the **toilet** that Greta has produced from her cart.
4. **Flush.** The sound echoes like applause in an abandoned opera house.

Then they leave, in absolute silence, through a door labeled “PAST THIS POINT, ONLY FERMENT.”

**Marshall McLuhan (offstage, choked with joy):**
> “Behold! *The content has rejected the medium!*”

**T.S.**, now entirely horizontal on a chaise longue, raises one finger.

**T.S.:**
> “I think… I love them.”

**Curtain. (Pulled down like a shower curtain in a cheap motel.)**
