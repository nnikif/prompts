# *Scene III: The Vestibule of Grief (Etching in Dust and Dream)*

> *Executed in the collaborative spirit of Käthe Kollwitz and Bruno Schulz, this scene exists not in motion, but in quiet pressure — as if pressed into the paper by grief itself. Grain, soot, and dream-detritus compose the mise-en-scène.*

## Tableau: *The Vestibule of Grief*

The stage is low-ceilinged and intimate, like a chamber beneath a funeral chapel. Walls of flaked plaster seem to pulse with old breath. Etched into them are half-erased charcoal drawings: women in profile, wolves at their heels, violins dissolving into skeletal trees.

**T.S.** sits hunched on a child-sized wooden chair. She wears a schoolgirl's coat — threadbare, oversized, embroidered with impossible insects. Her hair is powdered with ash. Before her, a warped toy theatre. Inside it: tiny versions of herself trapped in puppet roles — ingénue, witch, lover, ghost — all fashioned from rags and dried petals.

On the walls: **drawn windows**, offering no escape.

**A Drawer opens by itself.** Inside: letters written in soot. When touched, they vanish.

From the shadows, **paper-thin silhouettes** emerge — the figures of other daughters of narrative, now abstracted into glyphs and thread.

A **light flickers**: not illumination, but a memory of warmth.

No music. Only the sound of pencil scratching. A sound without hand or author.

**Curtain.**
