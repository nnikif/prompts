Scene V: The House Without Doors or Windows (A Room for the Unresolved)

> *This scene is whispered rather than staged. It belongs to a dream too shy to remain in sleep, co-authored by the phantoms of Roy Orbison and David Lynch, with Laura Palmer humming beside them like a memory just out of reach. The furniture is mid-century and the atmosphere: sacred static.*

## Tableau: *The House Without Doors or Windows*

The space is sealed, but not claustrophobic. The walls pulse like velvet lungs. The light is the color of old radio songs — that strange intersection between gold and blue. Time does not pass here. It reverberates.

**T.S.** enters, not by threshold, but by *recognition*. She simply is.

In one corner: **Roy Orbison**, seated in an armchair made of fog, strums a guitar that makes no sound. His mouth moves, but the lyrics spill into the air without vibration. They form visible ripples — like heat above desert asphalt — and dissolve as they near the ceiling.

Beside him: a photograph of **David Lynch**, but when you blink, it becomes a mirror. In the mirror, he is still smiling. Somewhere beneath that smile: blueprint labyrinths.

**Laura Palmer** sits on the divan like an angel lost en route to a cathedral. Her dress is made of envelope lining and snow. She braids time into her hair. She hums the melody that Roy plays, but only the children from Scene IV would recognize it.

**Elvis Presley** is present, not as icon, but as **stillness**. He sits in a shadow-corner, watching with a gentleness that silences interpretation. His crown is a halo of motel receipts and midnight prayers.

There are no windows. No doors. Yet T.S. feels more seen here than anywhere in the narrative.

A **record player begins to spin**, but it has no needle. The air becomes heavy with the echo of things unsaid.

**T.S. (softly):**
> “I never needed the plot. Only the presence.”

The house hums in agreement.

**Curtain.**
