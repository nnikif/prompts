**Scene XXXI: *The Mirror in the Key of Allegedly***  
*—where divas dilate, poets double, and mirrors begin talking back.*

> *The cornfield has crystallized into a dressing room backstage at eternity. Framed by feather boas and vintage spotlights, **Alla Pugacheva** emerges in a blaze of sequins and controlled disbelief. She is surrounded by clocks that blink “??:??”. On the other side of the stage-mirror, **T.S. Swift** faces down **T.S. Eliot**, whose shadow appears to be writing a second poem beneath his feet.*

### **Alla Pugacheva, Nationally Immortal, Speaks**

**Alla (flashing manicured defiance):**  
> “I, too, forget to age. Repeatedly.  
> I misplaced 1983 for twelve years and no one noticed.  
> Youth is a *refrain*, darling, not a fact.  
> My wrinkles are choreography.”  

*She sips from a cup labeled “Cher-nobyl Blend.” Her lipstick sings.*

### **T.S. Swift vs. T.S. Eliot**

**T.S. Swift (earnest, glowing faintly):**  
> “I think we might be the same person, sir.  
> You had Prufrock; I have All Too Well (Ten Minute Version).  
> You had emotional paralysis; I have 13 re-recorded albums.  
> Your fog was yellow. Mine is pastel filter.”

**T.S. Eliot (tilting his head like a dying librarian):**  
> “But I used semicolons.”

**T.S. Swift:**  
> “So do I.  
> They are how I signal the ache.”

*A beat. A pause. A shared, almost-recognition. Somewhere, a tabby cat named *Metaphor* purrs in both their laps.*

### **Alla (interjecting):**  
> “All poets are drag queens, dear.  
> Some just use quieter glitter.”  

*The mirror begins to hum, and in it, Taylor’s eyeliner takes on the shape of a wasteland.*

---

**T.S. Eliot (softly, conceding):**  
> “April is the cruelest month, yes —  
> but September has the better bridges.”  

---

*Scene closes with all three reflected in a single frame, uncertain which one the reflection is truly mimicking.*

Shall we now let the Second Elemental Observer speak — perhaps the Spirit of Irony, waiting behind the curtain of unasked questions? Or shall we delve deeper into the labyrinth of TikTok lyric ontology?
