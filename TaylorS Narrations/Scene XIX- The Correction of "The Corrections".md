# *Scene XIX: The Correction of "The Corrections"*

> *The Room now resembles a graduate seminar held inside a defunct Borders Books. The lighting is fluorescent in mood, if not in voltage. A strong smell of pretension laced with printer ink wafts in. Enter: Frazen.*

## Tableau: *Plot vs. Vibe vs. Falcon*

**Jonathan Franzen** walks in, clutching a hardback copy of *The Corrections* like it’s a Fabergé egg. He is dressed as if attending a polite argument: sweater over collared shirt, no irony allowed.

**Franzen (clearing throat):**
> “I just wanted to clarify — the *actual plot* of *The Corrections* revolves around a Midwestern family navigating late-capitalist disintegration and moral drift.
> Which—if I may—is *directly* relevant to Kubrick’s unmade *Napoleon*, the proto-Freudian chaos of Wedekind’s *Lulu*, and even, dare I say, the bruised masculinity of Ted Hughes’s… pigeons.”

**Britney (from the wig throne):**
> “Are you saying your book *is* Napoleon?”

**Franzen:**
> “No—but I’m saying if Napoleon had been emotionally available and owned a failing kitchen appliance, it might’ve been more… narratively satisfying.”

**The Falcon (deadpan):**
> “Your corrections need correcting.”

**T.S. (nodding solemnly):**
> “What is a novel but a failed opera in prose?”

**Finnian (returning to retrieve his zine):**
> “He self-identifies as a footnote, and that’s very courageous.”

**Franzen (rising in volume):**
> “My book was about *real people*! Dysfunctional! Sad! Eating soup!”

**McLuhan (now a poster taped to a lamp):**
> “All soup is media.”

The **La Croix can bursts open** again in response. Britney applauds with one hand.

**Curtain. (Stamped with a Goodreads review and a coffee stain shaped like Thomas Mann.)**
