# *Scene XVII: The Method and the Misdirection*

> *The Room now reconfigures itself into a minimalist greenroom. There are mirrors that don’t reflect and wigs that seem to whisper. A pink light pulses. Somewhere, an old tabloid headline rustles like tinfoil in the HVAC. This is where the myth breaks character.*

## Tableau: *The Wig Interview*

**Britney Spears** enters, wearing a platinum-blonde wig over another wig, seated in a director’s chair labeled *Napoleon's Real Wife*. She holds a La Croix can like it’s a loaded confession.

**Britney (intensely):**
> “I prepared for six months.
> Lived entirely on croissants, slept on a cannonball, practiced whispering imperial secrets into a mirror at 3:33 a.m.
> Wore velvet at all times. Even in the jacuzzi.”

She takes a sip, then glares.

> “And then I find out — *Kubrick’s been dead since forever?*
> No one told me!
> Not my team, not Matt Drudge, not the chandelier I trusted!”

She stands up, the chair squeaking its disapproval.

> “And when I got mad — when I threw a baguette at a casting intern and stormed into a TikTok live with a falcon on my shoulder —
> *people were mad at me.*

> Not at Kubrick. Not at Drudge.
> At me!”

A nearby **drone camera nods sympathetically**, its lens misting over.

**Britney (softly):**
> “Maybe I was Napoleon.
> Maybe I still am.
> Or maybe I was just Josephine trying to find a scene with lines that made sense.”

From backstage, **T.S.** whispers:

**T.S.:**
> “The crown is velvet, but the weight is Wikipedia.”

**McLuhan (as a scrolling chyron):**
> “In the age of simulation, even wigs are prophetic.”

The **La Croix can opens itself again.** It sighs.

**Curtain. (Trimmed in tabloid clippings and artificial rose petals.)**
