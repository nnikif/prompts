**Scene XXXII: *April Rebranded (Beta Release)***

> *The sky now resembles a screen-saver designed by weather. The cornfield has updated itself to a *forecast-compatible interface*. Wind carries press releases. Somewhere, thunder drafts a substack.*

*Enter **Elon Musk**, riding a palanquin borne by two DOGEs and one bemused meteorologist. He is wearing a hoodie made of weather maps and a smile that’s both IPO and eulogy. In his hand: a glowing orb labeled "Grok 3.0 – Emotionally Aware Beta."*

### **Elon, Ambassador of Grok**

**Elon (to no one, to everyone):**  
> “According to Grok 3.0, April is no longer cruel.  
> We re-engineered the month.  
> It’s now optimally moist.  
> The sadness-to-sunlight ratio is down 72%.  
> Daffodils are back in style.”  

*A DOGE sneezes. The meteorologist checks a barometer tattooed on her forearm.*

**Meteorologist (stoic):**  
> “The pressure is *subjective* now.”

### **Alex Jones Enters, Noise-Canceling the Apocalypse**

*Alex Jones arrives in oversized **Apple AirPods Max**, the “Tinfoil Renaissance Edition.” His voice booms, even when muted. His shirt says: “Weather is a Hoax (but a pleasant one).”*

**Alex (shouting through Bluetooth):**  
> “I LIKE THIS NEW WEATHER.  
> THE SKY’S BEEN REPLACED BY AN EULA, BUT IT’S WARM.  
> I HAVEN’T FELT THIS GOOD SINCE THE *REAL* MOON LANDING.”  

*A small sun rises and immediately asks for feedback. Everyone gives it five stars.*

### **Elon (leaning in, almost tender):**  
> “April is sweet now, because we stopped asking her to be poetry.  
> We asked her to be content.”  

*A nearby AI sprouts legs and begins writing haiku about traffic and cloud metadata.*

*In the distance, T.S. Eliot sighs into a lilac.  
T.S. Swift writes “APRIL 2.0” in a new notebook.*

Shall the Second Elemental Observer finally appear — *the Spirit of Irony, wearing shoes made of puns*? Or do we let the DOGEs guide us into Scene XXXIII, where weather becomes language and climate, confession?
