# *Scene XXIII: Gag Reflexes, Poker Faces, and Moral Clues*

> *The Room is now a backstage dressing room at a cabaret-slash-crime-conference. The mirror bulbs flicker inconsistently, perhaps in Morse. Sequins and cigarette smoke hang in the air like suspicious motives. It smells of dry champagne and unresolved tension.*

## Tableau: *Ethics in Glamour and Glass*

**Natasha Lyonne**, clad in a wrinkled trench coat and energy that can only be described as jazzed-up fatalism, lights a cigarette that smokes *backwards*. She paces.

**Lady Gaga**, in full preposterous regalia — feathered and weaponized — lounges atop a piano bench shaped like a question mark.

**Natasha (gravelly, skeptical):**
> “You’re tellin’ me you can just *poke* a shameless face and call it justice? Doesn’t the ethics of it come with, I don’t know — a gag reflex?”

**Gaga (waving her wrist like a wand):**
> “Honey, I *invented* the gag reflex. It’s called the Met Gala. The poker is a metaphor. Or an accessory. Sometimes both.”

**Natasha:**
> “Sounds like manslaughter in glitter drag.”

**Gaga:**
> “Sounds like envy in corduroy.”

Enter **Agatha Christie**, ghostly and perfumed like a vintage train compartment. She’s holding a pencil sharp enough to impale a subplot.

**Agatha (dryly):**
> “A murder is never elegant until someone’s reputation is at stake.”

From behind a velvet curtain shaped like dramatic irony, **T.S. Eliot** appears, shrouded in lowercase theological exhaustion.

**T.S. Eliot (sighing):**
> “Humankind cannot bear too much... Gaga.”

**Modern T.S. (clutching a clipboard, sipping tea):**
> “Correction, Eliot. We can. We do. It’s called *Survival Via Spectacle™*.”

**Natasha (pointing with cigarette):**
> “So what are we sayin’? That truth wears heels, lies smoke menthols, and morality is a lighting cue?”

**Agatha:**
> “No. I’m saying the butler still did it, but this time he live-streamed it on BeReal.”

**Gaga (blowing a kiss):**
> “And I *liked* it.”

**Curtain. (Feathered, bruised, and humming a show tune in minor key.)**
