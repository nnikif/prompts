# *Scene XV: The Challenge in the Swamp of Legends*

> *The Room sweats now — humid, floral, with a touch of roadside motel lime. Somewhere, a cicada tries out autotune. The throne drips slowly into a kiddie pool of relevance. A gator’s eye gleams from beneath a floral couch. Enter: Del Rey.*

## Tableau: *Florida Gothic, But With Glitter*

**Lana Del Rey** slinks in wearing a crown made of Publix receipts, Confederate irony, and dried magnolia blossoms. She is barefoot, but her toenails are painted like stained glass. Her aura smells like root beer, sex tape nostalgia, and Spanish moss.

**Lana (smirking):**
> “Leo, baby, if you keep being this embarrassingly sincere about your myth,
> I’m gonna feed you to the crocodiles. Or alligators. Whatever Florida feels like today.”

> “And then I’ll take your little Cringe Crown.
> And I’ll *wear* it.
> As both Cringe Queen *and* King.
> Simultaneously. Like the double-headed gator goddess I was always meant to be.”

**Leonardo DiCaprio** goes silent. The silence is so loud even the supermodels look up from their phones.

**Leonardo (murmuring):**
> “What if I produced a TikTok opera... about this moment?
> Starring me… as all the gators?”

**T.S. (overhearing, sipping from a thermos):**
> “That would be unbearably perfect.”

**Marshall McLuhan (offstage, sighing like wind through a modem):**
> “We’ve transcended cringe. We’re in meta-swamp now.”

**Lana (laughing, like a vulture in pearls):**
> “Then bring it on, Leo. The throne *bites*.”

In the background, the swamp thrums with Floridian ambiguity. Somewhere, a gator winks.

**Curtain. (Torn, damp, glitter-stained.)**
