# *Scene VIII: Deep Waters and the Absent-Minded Oracle*

> *The laughter of Scene VII echoes faintly as we return — not solemnly, but with a slow inward breath. The Room remains Tommy’s, but now its edges blur like waterlogged pages. A mist gathers. Memory shifts. And a voice rises from below the surface.*

## Tableau: *The Mirror-Pool Beneath the Room*

A trapdoor opens — not from the floor, but from within the air itself. **Natalie Wood** emerges as if drawn upward by thought alone. Her gown is seafoam and telegram paper, and her hair drips gently with memory. There is no violence in her presence, only a bemused grace.

She sits at a vanity that reflects not her face, but the last film she never finished. The mirror hums with ship horns and lines of drowned poetry.

**Natalie (dreamily):**
> “I wasn’t tragic, you know.
> Just… absent-minded.
> I was thinking about the third act.
> And forgot I was still living the second.”

She laughs — like wind chimes caught in a tide pool.

**Natalie (continued):**
> “T.S. — the other one — Eliot — he warned me.
> He said, ‘Fear death by water.’
> I said, ‘Only if the water has dialogue.’”

A slow current of typewritten lines swirls at her feet:

> *Those are pearls that were her eyes.*  
> *The sea was calm, your boat capsize.*  
> *In Deep Waters we are most awake.*

From the side, **T.S.** (our T.S.) kneels beside Natalie.

They hold hands. Neither seeks to rewrite the ending. They simply read the tide.

Behind them, **a conch shell speaks briefly in Morse code**, and goes still.

**Baldwin (again, unseen):**
> “The ones we thought gone often become the most lucid narrators.”

**Curtain.**
