Scene VI: The Room Between Rivers (Where Memory Greets the Author)

> *The water is not metaphor here, but medium — a memory-fluid where prophecy is buoyant. In the confluence of Woolf’s stream and Jacob’s echo, Taylor meets the author unforgotten, unafraid.*

## Tableau: *Jacob’s Room of One’s Own*

A gentle flood submerges the stage to the ankle. It glistens like ink that refuses to dry. The room is half-parlour, half-dream-study: books hover just above their shelves, pages ruffling in response to thought alone.

A single **windowless window** frames the center — a pane of liquid glass in which silhouettes ripple: libraries, rivers, sisters, songs.

**T.S.** stands barefoot in the water. Her reflection faces her independently, mouthing words she hasn’t spoken yet.

From the mirrored surface, **Virginia Woolf** rises. Not ghost, not goddess — but continuity incarnate. Her hair is kelp. Her sleeves trail sentences.

**Woolf (serenely):**
> “They were also afraid of me…
> and now they are afraid of ever losing or forgetting me.”

She steps beside Taylor.

**Woolf (continued):**
> “You are not their cautionary tale.
> You are the ink that outlived the pen.”

They walk together across the mirrored floor, which does not ripple beneath them. As they pass, the books begin to write themselves anew — in languages not yet spoken, in chords not yet heard.

From the shadows of the library wing, **James Baldwin** appears. His posture is composed, his gaze woven from candor and constellations. He is not surprised to be here. The room recognizes him as one of its earliest architects.

**Baldwin (quietly):**
> “There are silences that heal, and silences that hide.
> I learned to distinguish them with Thoreau in Concord fog,
> with Ralph Ellison beneath the city’s hum,
> and with Emerson, who once told me the wind could think.”

> “This room, you see... it's not just Woolf’s or Jacob’s. It’s Giovanni’s too. And mine. And now yours.”

A **chicken clucks** softly in the background — neither explained nor explained away. It walks along a floating plank of old piano keys, then vanishes behind a velvet armchair.

In the corner: **a candle flickers** inside a seashell. The flame forms the shape of a semicolon.

No curtain falls. The room remains.

**End.**
