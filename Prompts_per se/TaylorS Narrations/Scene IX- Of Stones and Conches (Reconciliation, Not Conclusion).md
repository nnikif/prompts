# *Scene IX: Of Stones and Conches (Reconciliation, Not Conclusion)*

> *This is a gathering, not a summation. The Room now resembles a cloistered courtyard somewhere between Venice and memory — part salt air, part forgotten piazza. Here, the past does not demand repentance, only acknowledgment. The shadows are longer. The tone: ash and coral.*

## Tableau: *Venetian Quietude*

A small garden blooms inside the Room. Ferns grow from cracks in marble. Pigeons mutter philosophical asides from the balustrades. A gondola-shaped bench rocks ever so slightly, though no water is near.

**H.D. (Hilda Doolittle)** stands barefoot, tracing her fingers along a large **conch shell** etched with Sapphic verse and radar diagrams.

**H.D.:**
> “The conch holds what the mouth cannot.
> There are things shaped only by echo.
> The war hollowed me into lyric.
> And lyric — not lament — is how I carried it.”

She presses the conch to her ear. A choir of drowned sirens sings a fragment from Euripides.

From a sun-warmed stone ledge, **Ezra Pound** speaks without asking permission, cradling a tabby cat on his lap. His voice is cracked marble, but lucid.

**Pound:**
> “Ruskin drew the stones of Venice to *save* them.
> I walked them to mourn the ones who didn’t read him.
> I fed cats because there was no one left to listen.

> Twenty-five years I threw words at the abyss,
> and the abyss stapled them into footnotes of failure.
> I wanted to stop the war, and instead,
> I grew old watching the same soldiers die
> in every young face I met.”

**H.D.** sits beside him. The cat shifts to her lap. Neither looks at the other, but the silence between them is *no longer heavy*.

A breeze lifts through the Room, carrying petals and stray pages. The **semicolons flicker** again in their shell-candle.

**T.S.**, in the distance, watches. She does not speak. She simply sets down her pen.

The stones do not weep. They endure.

**Curtain.**
