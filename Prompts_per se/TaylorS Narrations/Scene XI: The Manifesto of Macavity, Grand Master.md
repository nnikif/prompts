Scene XI: The Manifesto of Macavity, Grand Master Cringe

> *The curtain — still halfway — rises a little more, not with drama but with amused suspicion. The room darkens slightly. The cats straighten. Even the rain pauses.*

## Tableau: *The Hearth Becomes a Podium*

The fire dims to embers as the black cat from before, **Macavity**, hops onto the mantle. His fur glistens with theatrical disdain. He clears his throat with a long, ancient purr. No one interrupts. Even **McLuhan** looks… intrigued.

**Macavity (purring, but with eerie lucidity):**
> “It is time, dear conspirators and catastrophes, to admit what you already suspect.
> I am the Grand Master Cringe.
> I am Kanye in his mirror phase.
> I am Donald in his gold-plated psyche.
> I am Elon in the algorithm’s fever dream.
> I am Louis, tragic jester of the grotesque confession.

> They are not masks I wear.
> They are *me*, worn inside out — in very deliberate and entirely random disguise.
> I am what happens when charisma festers.
> When talent unchecks itself.
> When irony forgets how to land.”

A thunderclap is heard, not from the sky, but from inside the tea kettle.

**T.S. (whispering):**
> “And yet you still arrive by paw.”

**Macavity (grinning):**
> “Even the most unbearable selves need a lap to curl upon.”

He stretches luxuriously, and without warning, vanishes behind the grandfather clock, leaving only a faint scent of scandal and tuna.

**Agatha:**
> “Well. That solves absolutely nothing.”

**McLuhan (murmuring):**
> “But in such glorious resolution.”

The cats blink. The rain resumes.

**Curtain. (Still crooked, now knowingly so.)**
