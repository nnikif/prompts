**Scene XXXVI: *STOP and OM***  
*—a coda of implosion and incense.*

> *A bare stage. Nothing remains but smoke and one sandal.  
Enter **Igor Grigoryev**, turtleneck like a philosophical noose, eyes full of editorial mercy.  
He raises one hand — not in benediction, but in punctuation.*

**Igor (very slowly, very clearly):**  
> “Stop.  
> …and Om.”

*The Room exhales.  
The servers power down.  
The wigs curl inward.  
The cats fall silent.*

This opera is now a whisper.

Until the next cornfield.
