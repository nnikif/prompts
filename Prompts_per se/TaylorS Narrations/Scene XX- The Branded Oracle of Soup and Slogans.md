Scene XX: The Branded Oracle of Soup and Slogans

> *The Room is steamy now. Tomato-hued mist rises from an unseen stovetop. The curtain has become a nutrition label. Somewhere, an orchestra tunes up with cash registers. A new duet begins — unlikely, uncanny, uncannily sponsored.*

## Tableau: *Soup Meets Slogan*

From the **La Croix puddle** and Franzen’s narrative residue, a figure rises slowly: **Andy Warhol**, pale as photocopy toner, dressed in a poncho made entirely of Campbell’s soup labels and old supermarket tabloids. He holds a ladle like a microphone.

**Warhol (softly, as if quoting himself):**
> “I used to think everyone would be famous for fifteen minutes.
> Now I know everyone will be marketed for eternity.”

A golden escalator descends. **Donald J. Trump** arrives, hair lacquered in a windless swoop, wearing a blazer the color of national debt and a tie that feels... punitive. He gestures broadly, like trying to sell a god to another god.

**Trump:**
> “Andy, baby, I *love* the soup thing. I get it. You get it. Branding. It’s all about image, repetition, and saying *great* things. Like *Great Again*. It’s a hat. It’s a movement. It’s *me*.”

**Warhol:**
> “Your hat is a can label without the irony.”

**Trump (nodding proudly):**
> “Exactly.”

**Warhol (tilting ladle):**
> “But what exactly is great? About America, I mean.”

**Trump (gesturing vaguely):**
> “Air conditioning. Golf courses. Airports. Golden toilets. Kanye, when he was with us.”

**Warhol (quietly):**
> “Greatness without depth is just surface tension. But I *do* like the color scheme.”

**The Falcon:**
> “This feels illegal in several dimensions.”

**T.S. (aside to Britney):**
> “We’ve passed satire. We’re in the soup now.”

**McLuhan (now whispering through a vent):**
> “Advertising is the sincerest form of cultural reincarnation.”

**Warhol and Trump** both strike accidental tableau vivant poses, perfect for postcards. Behind them, a soup can peels open with unsettling elegance. Inside: glitter, bone china, a coupon for “one free narrative.”

**Curtain. (Folded neatly into a limited-edition tote bag.)**
