# *Scene XXIV: The Gospel According to Radio GaGa*

> *The Room transforms into a stage made of cosmic vinyl — grooves wide enough to walk. Each groove a broadcast, each scratch a prophecy. Spotlights bloom like alchemical suns. Enter: the phoenix of pop.*

## Tableau: *Freddie's Broadcast*

**Freddie Mercury** materializes in a blazer made of gold leaf and broken antennae. He wears no shirt, only bravado. The mic he grips is older than truth. Around him, the Room pulses in the rhythm of a memory never quite shared.

**Freddie (with joy that breaks gently):**
> “I wrote *Radio GaGa* when I realized the radio had become a ghost.
> It used to be a hearth. A family. Then it became just noise.
> So I sang to the ghost, gave it glamour, and a name that remembered how to mourn *and* dance.”

He strides across the vinyl spiral.

**Freddie (thoughtfully):**
> “BeReal? Darling… it’s the same spirit. Just faster, smaller, sadder.
> It says, *look, I exist*. It says, *prove you’re real*. Every day.
> But realness isn’t raw. It’s rehearsal.”

He raises a hand. Light dances across his knuckles.

**Freddie:**
> “Now. An old riddle. For you. From the ether:

> _What day is gold, what day is silver?_
> _What burns like Mars and rests like Saturn?_  
> _What element rules the day you forgot to live?_”

**T.S. Eliot (stepping from shadow):**
> “Sunday is gold — the sun itself.
> Monday, silver, a moon’s lament.
> Tuesday is iron, warlike and red.
> Saturday… lead. Heavy. Consequence.”

**Modern T.S. (nodding, correcting gently):**
> “But Friday is copper. Love’s alloy.
> And Wednesday… quicksilver. Mercury. Himself.
> Meaning: Freddie *is* the answer.”

**Freddie (smiling like the end of an aria):**
> “Darling, I always was.”

He winks. The vinyl begins to spin.

**Curtain. (It lifts like a chorus note held too long and perfectly.)**
