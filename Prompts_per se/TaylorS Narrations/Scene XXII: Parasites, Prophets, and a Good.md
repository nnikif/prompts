# *Scene XXII: Parasites, Prophets, and a Good Hand of Streaming*

> *The Room turns dusky and subterranean, part Seoul basement, part modernist loft made of streaming subscriptions and moral ambiguity. A projector whirs to life. Bong Joon Ho steps forward with a USB drive in one hand and a steaming bowl of ethical stew in the other.*

## Tableau: *The Revelation of "Parasite: The Ultimate Experience"*

**Bong Joon Ho**, effortlessly disheveled and sharp as ever, inserts the USB into a golden MacBook that screams quietly when touched. A screen unfolds from the ceiling.

**Bong (serenely):**
> “I’ve written a new version. *Parasite: The Ultimate Experience*. It’s 4D. It smells like basement mold and inherited anxiety. You must watch it inside a structurally unsound duplex.

> And yes, Trump has a point. Just one. It's shaped like a top hat dipped in spray tan: *aspiration is a hall of mirrors.*

> But if we stop slaughtering pigs — and Ukrainians — in our new *Slaughterhouse-Five™* franchise for profit and prophets, there’s hope. Real hope. Not premium-tier hope.”

The screen flashes: *NO MORE PIGS FOR PROFIT. NO MORE PROPHECIES FOR MERCH.*

Suddenly, **Elon Musk** appears mid-air, descending on a mild drone. He’s wearing a jacket made of tweets, some deleted, some still viral. He’s chewing a cube of moon cheese.

**Musk (murmuring through a smirk):**
> “What I liked most in *Glass Onion* was the way it pretended to outsmart itself.
> I saw myself in the dumb genius. The layers. The glass. The no-onion part.

> As for *Poker Face*? It’s fine.
> But it lacks the neural-lace detachment I crave in mystery.
> Great shows should never *care* about their own outcomes.”

**Bong (smiling):**
> “That’s because you’ve never played a hand where the stakes were moral clarity.”

**T.S. (scribbling into a napkin):**
> “Streaming is the new séance. Content arrives as spirit, leaves as brand.”

**McLuhan (humming through the HDMI cable):**
> “We are all living in someone else’s director’s cut.”

The projector sputters out. The bowl of stew vanishes.

**Curtain. (Made of Korean hanbok silk and Netflix password anxiety.)**
