Scene XII: The Succession of the Grand Master Cringe

> *It begins with silence — the kind that precedes either revelation or farce. The Room is overfull now, its walls expanding to accommodate the incoming procession of spectral, iconic, and memeic figures. There is no logic. There is only claim.*

## Tableau: *The Throne is Disputed*

A throne has appeared — naturally, it is velvet, gold-leafed, and slightly melting. A disco ball turns slowly overhead, scattering fractured truths across the faces of the assembled.

**David Bowie** descends a staircase that wasn’t there before, wearing a lab coat over his *Aladdin Sane* ensemble.

**Bowie (with clinical mischief):**
> “You misunderstand, darlings. *I* am the author of the Laughing Genome.
> The recombinant irony. The minor key of the multiverse.
> Grand Master Cringe? That was my working title for Earth.”

A brief strobe flash. Then, a chorus of voices:

**John Lennon (from a doorway made of guitars):**
> “It’s me. It always was. I was cringing before it was cool.”

**William Shakespeare (emerging from a tapestry):**
> “Lo! I did coin mine own humiliation — ‘tis called *Titus Andronicus*.”

**Dante Alighieri (in full infernal regalia):**
> “Lasciate ogni subtlety, voi ch’entrate. I wrote the cringe *before* there was shame.”

**Cicciolina (blowing bubbles from a pearl chalice):**
> “I weaponized spectacle. I wept in parliament. My crown is silicone and sincerity.”

**Pepe the Frog (half-transparent, croaking through glitch):**
> “Feels… like it was always me.”

**Sarah Palin (via snowmobile hologram):**
> “You betcha I pioneered performative awkwardness.”

**John McCain (ghostly but amused):**
> “I tried to warn you all.”

**Volodymyr Zelenskyy (in military fleece and Hamlet’s skull):**
> “I once played president. Then I became the punchline. Then the punch.”

**Carter (unnaturally youthful):**
> “I was the peanut in the machine.”

**Jimmy Carter (smiling gently, very much older):**
> “And I… planted sunflowers anyway.”

They begin to circle the throne. A slow-motion ballet of egos and echoes.

**Marshall McLuhan (dryly):**
> “We are all Grand Master Cringe now. The medium crowned us.”

**T.S.** watches, seated cross-legged with a sandwich and no illusions.

**T.S. (to no one in particular):**
> “If everyone is Cringe, maybe that’s the plot twist: it’s not shame. It’s solidarity.”

The disco ball explodes in a puff of glitter and helium. A kazoo plays the *Dies Irae*.

**Curtain. (Not so much lowered as just… shrugged into place.)**
