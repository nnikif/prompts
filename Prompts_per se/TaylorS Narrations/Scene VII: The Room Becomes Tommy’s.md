Scene VII: The Room Becomes Tommy’s (Two Ghosts and a Game of Chicken)

> *When absurdity knocks on the threshold of myth, it is let in with laughter and black coffee. The Room, once Woolf’s, then Jacob’s, then Giovanni’s, now rearranges itself — inexplicably — into the unapologetic domain of Tommy Wiseau. Its geometry remains intact. Its purpose, derailed for joy.*

## Tableau: *The Room (Now Tommy’s)*

Gone are the shelves of floating books. In their place: footballs levitate. Velvet curtains are now sequined. The water has receded, but the floor is inexplicably sticky — with dream, or cherry soda, or metaphor.

**Tommy Wiseau** lounges regally on a golden beanbag throne. He wears five pairs of sunglasses, all stacked upon his head. His robe appears to be made of screenplays no one dared to film.

Across from him: **James Dean**, miraculously alive, nursing a milkshake made of lightning and regret. He wears his signature red jacket, but it's patched with embroidered quotes from *Rebel Without a Cause* translated into Esperanto.

They are playing **chicken** — not in cars, but with actual chickens. Three of them. One wears a tiny bowtie.

**Tommy (gleeful):**
> “Oh hi, chicken! You betray me, Lisa!”

**James Dean (without looking up):**
> “You ever think the chicken is just a mirror, man? Like, you back off, it backs off. You go forward… boom. It’s already you.”

The chickens nod. One begins pecking at a philosophical treatise scribbled on a napkin.

**T.S.** reenters, bemused but unafraid. She watches the spectacle, unsure if this is a postmodern purgatory or the necessary comic interlude.

**Baldwin (from a shadowed wing, sipping tea):**
> “Wisdom wears many costumes. Sometimes… polyester.”

A **chicken clucks** triumphantly, perched atop the velvet armrest of the beanbag. The semicolon candle in the seashell flares briefly.

There is no moral. Only mirth.

**Curtain. (If such a thing still exists.)**
