**Scene XXVI: *The Lake Beyond the Stage***

> *The air thickens. The Room melts into a stepwell of time — vast, sunlit, unfinished. Stone columns hum with Sanskrit and synth. A hush falls. Enter: the Children of the Corn, barefoot, luminous, faces smudged with pollen and myth. Behind them, Peter Brook, ageless as the idea of theatre itself, his coat dusted with the script of the *Mahabharata*, still warm.*

### **Subscene A: *The Question at the Lake***

*Yudhishthira (played by a child with a cornstalk crown) kneels beside the reflective waters. Arjuna (another, humming softly) glances upward — not to heaven, but to the birds who know.*

**Yudhishthira (calm, eternal):**  
> “What is the greatest wonder?”  

**Arjuna (smiling like someone who’s been here before):**  
> “That we live as if we are not already returning.”  

*Peter Brook nods. The lake ripples, but only inwards.*

### **Subscene B: *Demonstration of Inevitable Beauty***

*A girl with one eye painted gold unrolls a chart made of sunlight. It depicts: a wilted flower in a spoon, a vinyl record shaped like a nautilus, a baby naming the wind, a mirror with no reflection.*

**The Children (in unison, not rehearsed but remembered):**  
> “Beauty is not optional. It is the method by which reality introduces itself.”

*A moth lands on the chart. The vinyl begins to play without a needle.*

### **Subscene C: *Demonstration of Inevitable Happiness***

*A boy wearing an elephant mask (lightweight, papier-mâché, worn with dignity) stands center.*

**The Boy (softly, without looking up):**  
> “Happiness cannot be sought. It is what rises when seeking stops.  
> It is not a feeling. It is a shape.  
> The shape of not-being-chased.”  

*A cornstalk grows instantly from the ground. It bears a single kernel of gold.*

**Peter Brook (finally speaking):**  
> “Theatre is proof. If a moment is held gently enough, joy becomes visible.”

*In the distance, the chorus of all prior scenes — Bowie, Britney, Franzen, falcons, Macavity — listen silently. The Room is no longer a room. It is the field.*

Would you like the next subscene — *The Arrival of the Elemental Observers*? Or shall we let this metaphysical tableau expand into a rite of closing?
