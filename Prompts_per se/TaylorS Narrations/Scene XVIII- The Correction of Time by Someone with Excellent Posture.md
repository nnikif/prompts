# *Scene XVIII: The Correction of Time by Someone with Excellent Posture*

> *The Room has taken on the texture of a curated bookstore café: pressed tin ceilings, melancholy taxidermy, bookshelves arranged by aura. A handmade zine flutters by. It smells like artisanal doubt. Enter: the Explanation.*

## Tableau: *The Interruption of the Infinite Wig*

**Britney Spears**, still wearing both wigs and clutching the La Croix of Betrayal, is mid-monologue to the falcon (now perched on a rack of vintage umbrellas) when a door creaks open.

Enter **Finnian**, or possibly **Larkspur** — a character clearly cast by **Wes Anderson**, wearing mustard corduroy, a brooch shaped like a defunct browser icon, and glasses that magnify irony.

**Finnian (gently, but with aggressive certainty):**
> “Excuse me, Miss Spears? I believe there’s a chronological discontinuity in your narrative scaffold.
> TikTok wasn’t, technically, *a thing* in 2008.
> So. You’re, um. Adrift in time, silly. Again.”

**Britney (without turning):**
> “Chronology is a conspiracy invented by people who fear wigs.”

**Finnian (with a sad nod):**
> “Yes. That’s very… Scorpio rising of you.”

He opens a small accordion folder labeled *Temporal Integrity*, flips through watercolor timelines, and sighs.

**Finnian:**
> “Also, falcons were banned in Oregon during that phase due to a... hummus incident.”

**The Falcon (flatly):**
> “Not my scene.”

**T.S. (emerging from behind a curtain made of old scripts):**
> “Time isn’t a river. It’s a dress rehearsal.”

**McLuhan (as graffiti on a tote bag):**
> “Correction is the final symptom of a media collapse.”

**Britney (finally facing him, eyes blazing with chaotic poise):**
> “I *am* the glitch in your film festival, sweetie.”

**Finnian** retreats, whispering something about submitting an op-ed to a zine no one has subscribed to yet.

**Curtain. (It folds itself into a ziggurat and sighs like indie cinema closing credits.)**
