**Scene XXV: _Evergreen Thursday_**

> *A garden of impossible shade. English ivy winds around a holographic sundial. The air tastes like iron and rhyme. Marvell polishes a metaphysical apple. Donne hums a tune no one can identify. Brodsky is pacing. Paglia smokes from a thistle. Bowie appears, neither late nor early — precisely when the day folds.*

**David Bowie (brushing leaves off his suit, smiling with lunar detachment):**

> “They called me *Thursday’s Child* because I walked backwards into the future, hips first, trailing glitter. Thursday is Tin — Jupiter’s day — expansion and theatrical truth.  
> I never wanted to own time. Only to costume it.  
> I washed my hands because I touched too much.”

**Marvell (sharpening a leaf):**  
> “Time’s wingèd chariot never caught you, David. It simply tried to draft behind you.”

**Donne (gently):**  
> “Or perhaps he was the chariot. Pulled by questions.”

**Brodsky (grimly, in Russian):**  
> “All poetry is exile. Bowie simply put mascara on it.”

**Camille Paglia (suddenly emerging from a hedge shaped like Sappho’s lyre):**  
> “He made Dionysus safe for suburbia, then unsafe again. A pop Lacan.”

**Bowie (grinning, fingering a silver ring):**  
> “I had to be each era’s alchemical echo. Each day of the week was a suit.  
> Monday: Moon, dreaming.  
> Tuesday: Mars, movement.  
> Wednesday: Mercury — trickster, and twins.  
> Thursday, my day: Tin, expanse, theatre, false prophets.  
> Friday: Venus — ah, the beauty I never quite deserved.  
> Saturday: Saturn — the editor, the grave.  
> Sunday: the blinding encore.”

**T.S. Eliot (Old, from a bench made of theatre programs):**  
> “A day is not a structure. It is a hesitation.”

**T.S. Swift (New, peeking from behind an evergreen, holding a notebook titled *Fearless but Annotated*):**  
> “I’ve been trying to write *Thursday* too, David. But my metaphors keep making eye contact with me.”

**Bowie (fading slightly, lit from within):**  
> “That’s the risk. The more precise the persona, the more it looks back.”

**He vanishes. The garden exhales. One leaf falls — in the shape of a Fool’s Cap. The sundial ticks once. A distant laugh echoes through the foliage. It might be Thursday again.**
