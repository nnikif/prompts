**Prompt (Adjusted):**

> "A surreal, spiritual landscape inspired by Kandinsky and Max Ernst. Abstract forms evoke a cinematic memory — a field of shifting lines and mirrored pools under a textured sky. Stylized reeds flow like calligraphy. A small abstract animal shape moves across the field, quiet and watchful.  
> 
> In a montage of dreamlike fragments: a hand reaching for a sleeping cat, a cracked mirror reflecting a contemplative human face humming silently.  
> 
> Three symbolic figures — one dark, one radiant, one skeletal — stand in diagonal tension, surrounded by ghostly energy fields.  
> 
> Nearby, two playful, exaggerated animal forms dance through a surreal forest of spirals and floating orbs.  
> 
> In the sky: a scroll burns gently, its smoke forming symbols. An abstract sun twists inward, as though memory itself were collapsing.  
> 
> Style: Blended Kandinsky/Ernst abstraction with hints of sacred geometry. Color palette: dusky golds, soft pinks, indigo, rust, and pale green. Mood: mystical, reflective, dreamlike."
